# NBA-analysis

This is a Data Science project analyzing NBA trends.

Some things I hope to achieve whilst doing this project:
* Able to bring up any player stats from any season while being able to show his career stats (stats for all year they played in the NBA)
* Apply various techniques of collecting/reading data (python PANDAS, SQL/MongoDB, R, API calling wherever applicable), as well as improving web development skills (html, css, js)
* Potentially find court data per game to show hotspots/coldspots on the court similar to NBA 2K series (video game)

Some questions I hope to answer as a result:
* Analyze trends within the NBA playstyle (an example would be the increase in 3 point shots taken during a game and how effective it actually is)
* Discover players that are overrated/underrated solely based on statistics
* Which numeric values actually matter?
* Comparing NBA bubble statistics to non-bubble (in-bubble season was only 2019-2020 as far as I know)


Data we'll need:
* NBA season data (basketball-reference.com)
* NBA news data (maybe scraping some news site like NYT or local newspapers)
* NBA court data for shots [if possible]
